shutdown_costmaps: false

controller_frequency: 4.0 #5.0 The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
controller_patience: 2.0 #3.0 How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before
# space-clearing operations are performed.

planner_frequency: 2.0 #1.0
planner_patience: 6.0 #5.0 How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.

oscillation_timeout: 10.0 #10
oscillation_distance: 0.2 #0.2 How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating. 
#Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout

# local planner - default is trajectory rollout
